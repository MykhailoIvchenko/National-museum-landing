1. The project implements one-page landing according to given design. It is created to demonstrate html and CSS skills.
Landing is adapted for desctop, large screens, mobile and tablet.
In some places falsy links in href are used, because there no pages to visit in this landing (they could be implemented in the whole site).
So for example click on the button for tickets purchase will not affect opening any new page. Java Script was used a little just for making interactive behaviour for some elements, such as simple slider for mobile and tablet versions.

2. Technologies stack: HTML5, CSS3, BEM, SASS, JS.

4. The landing page is implemented according to this design: https://www.figma.com/file/cRBCqE06cDrY3s4jX7h3iY/%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9C%D0%A3-(Edit)?node-id=0%3A1

5. It is important to reload page (using ctrl-F5) after screen size or gadget changing in devTools to force JS recalculate variables for slider. In real gadgets we don't need to do that, because it is enough to make calculation after page loading â€“ screen size is physically the same on the one separate device.
